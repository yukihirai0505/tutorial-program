"I know this is asked quite a bit, but I've already read all the posts and i am looking for new coins or possibly ICOs. I'm trying to find a new perspective. What are some cool projects or technologies that are being worked on? 

 My 3 are REQ, XLM, KCS"
XRB, ICX, REQ
ICX way to go!
Exactly what I'm hodling. Plus ENJ.
"Iota
Eos
Ark"
Apparently you can't get EOS if you have a US IP address
IOTA, XRB, ARK
QASH, IOTA and NEO
Doge 
The king will rise
XRB, ICX, TRX
Iota, XRB, and Stellar.  I expect each to 5x to 10x next year.
I think XRB and REQ are going to be HUGE. I also like Wabi cause it's a working real world product that fixes a real world issue.  
Wabi looks interesting! ICO is closed though :/
Phore, Aeon and RaiBlocks
I hope phore delivers. 
"LISK - sleeping giant and still not a lot of people know its capability (10-15x in 2018)

VEN/VTC - CEO says theyâ€™ve got tons of projects lined up. Plus, China is always a good spot to put your $ (12-15x in 2018)

Ripple - Institutional support will grow. Too bad XRP has been premined though which more and more people will catch on to eventually lowering the price. (5x in 2018)"
"ELIX, XBY, ICX, OMG, XRB, PRL

I mainly go for new/small market cap coins."
Your strategy will definitely pay off
VIBE, NEO, ETP
I believe REQ, QASH, ICX, XMR, and NEO will see a lot of development and adoption this coming year 
"XRB has great potential, if it can emerge from its small time origins.

WTC, to me, is the very definition of a ""cool project"" that may change the world.  I think it has the chance to modernize, revolutionize, then fully penetrate manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, and logistics to a staggering, mind-boggling degree.  Maybe.  Maybe not.

Finally, I think REQ is a brilliant idea that has an 85% chance of vanishing in a crowded and competitive environment, and a 15% chance of making it in a big way."
QASH, MOD, REQ
"I will be invested in XBY XMR and ETH. 

I think XBY will hit $3 by early 2016. Thats like %1200, but also high risk. XMR and ETH will see stable growth with lower risk. "
I'm also bullish on XBY, though reaching $3 almost 2 years ago would be impressive to say the least!
Monero, Req, NLC2 no limit coin
Qash, Req, VeChain
"coss
vtc ark"
NEO, WTC, XRB
Folks are bullish on xlm but there are total 100 million coins and only 17 millions are in circulation. How will they plan to release orher coins? Any information about that? I own few and considering buying more
The top 6 in my portfolio: ENJ, ARK, XMR, REQ, RDN, ETH.
Icx aion wanchain
IOTA, XRB, COSS
Wait, Let me guess.... everyone said XRB, REQ, IOTA &amp; EOS?? and XBY 
I honestly think xrb is over hyped.
REQ, SNOV and ROC.
IOTA, PRL and DENT! 
STRAT, NXS, DOGE
NAV for sure. Too undervalued, a huge upward correction will happen soon. What happened to VTC and also XVG is what should have happened to NAV.
I think Substratum will continue upwards as countries continues to censor the Internet. I also think that Gifto might get a nice gain in value. About ICO's I think Wysker is the best one at the moment. You should check out www.wystoken.org 
OMG, NEO, ICX
REQ XRB ICX
NEO, MOD, REQ
No ENG? ðŸ¤”

"Stellar Lumens/XLM, QASH, and Factom

Ardor probably just missed those top three"
"iota - eos - gnt - ardr - ripple - bat (maybe,not sure (does not mean that i am sure about others) ) - verge (especially after thaath fake news and fud) - req - etn - icx (did not research it but hype is hype ) - omg - McafeepumpCoin. 

Good luck"
XVG, NEO, XRB
XVG is trash.
